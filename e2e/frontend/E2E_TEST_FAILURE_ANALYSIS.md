# E2E Test Failure Analysis

## Root Cause
All 140 E2E tests are failing because there's a mismatch between what the tests expect and what the frontend actually renders:

1. **Missing data-testid attributes**: The E2E tests are looking for elements with specific `data-testid` attributes (e.g., `[data-testid="features-section"]`), but the frontend components don't have these attributes.

2. **Component structure mismatch**: The tests expect specific page structures and elements that don't exist in the current frontend implementation.

## Evidence
- Test failure: `Timed out 10000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible() - Locator: locator('[data-testid="features-section"]')`
- Debug output shows: `Found 0 elements with data-testid`
- Frontend HTML inspection confirms no data-testid attributes are present

## Components Affected
Based on the test files, these components need data-testid attributes:

### HomePage (src/app/page.tsx & components)
- Hero section: `data-testid="hero-section"`
- Features section: `data-testid="features-section"`
- Feature cards: `data-testid="feature-card"`
- CTA section: `data-testid="cta-section"`
- CTA title: `data-testid="cta-title"`
- CTA button: `data-testid="cta-button"`

### Navigation/Header
- Get Started button: needs proper text or data-testid
- Try Demo/Learn More button: needs proper text or data-testid

### Forms (Registration/Login)
- Form fields need data-testid attributes
- Submit buttons need data-testid attributes
- Error messages need data-testid attributes

### Dashboard Components
- Quick enhance section
- Favorite techniques
- History items

### Enhance Page Components
- Prompt input: `data-testid="prompt-input"`
- Character count: `data-testid="character-count"`
- Enhance button: `data-testid="enhance-button"`
- Output section: `data-testid="enhanced-output"`
- Technique selection
- Error messages: `data-testid="error-message"`
- Progress indicators

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Add data-testid to Frontend Components (Recommended)
Add the missing data-testid attributes to all frontend components that the tests are expecting. This maintains the existing test structure and makes the tests more reliable.

### Option 2: Update Tests to Use Different Selectors
Modify the E2E tests to use different selectors (text content, roles, etc.) instead of data-testid. This is less reliable and more brittle.

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
Add data-testid to critical elements and update tests to be more flexible with selectors where appropriate.

## Next Steps
1. Update frontend components to include data-testid attributes
2. Ensure all interactive elements have proper accessibility attributes
3. Run tests again to verify fixes
4. Address any remaining issues

## Additional Issues Found
- Frontend container marked as "unhealthy" - needs health check investigation
- Missing static build files initially (resolved after container restart)
