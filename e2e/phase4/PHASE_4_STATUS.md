# Phase 4 Status Report

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Backend Implementation
1. **Fixed Database Schema Issues**
   - Changed all references from 'prompts' to 'prompts.history'
   - Fixed UUID generation to use proper UUIDs instead of custom format
   - Fixed techniques_used array handling with PostgreSQL

2. **Implemented History API Endpoints**
   - GET /api/v1/prompts/history - Paginated history with search/filter
   - GET /api/v1/prompts/:id - Get specific prompt details
   - POST /api/v1/prompts/:id/rerun - Rerun a prompt
   - All endpoints tested and working via curl

3. **Fixed API Gateway Issues**
   - Fixed CORS configuration to allow frontend requests
   - Moved /techniques and /enhance endpoints to public routes
   - Fixed techniques endpoint to return full technique objects with all required fields

### Frontend Fixes
1. **Fixed infinite loop in techniques fetching**
   - Removed fetchTechniques from useEffect dependencies
   
2. **Updated middleware configuration**
   - Made /enhance route public to match API endpoint
   - Kept /history as protected route

### E2E Testing Progress
1. **Created comprehensive test utilities**
   - AuthHelper with login/logout functionality
   - HistoryPage page object model
   - Test user registration scripts

2. **Implemented Phase 4 E2E tests**
   - Test for unauthenticated users being redirected âœ…
   - Test for authenticated enhancement flow (structurally passing)
   - Test for history persistence across sessions (structurally passing)

## Current Blockers ðŸš§

### 1. React Hydration Error
The frontend is experiencing SSR hydration mismatches related to theme handling:
```
className="h-full light" vs className="h-full"
style={{color-scheme:"light"}}
```

This is preventing pages from rendering properly and blocking all UI testing.

### 2. Enhancement Not Saving to History
While the backend endpoints are working, the enhancement flow isn't saving to history. This could be due to:
- The hydration error preventing proper page rendering
- The enhancement request not completing successfully
- Missing integration between enhancement and history saving

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix React Hydration Error**
   - Investigate theme provider implementation
   - Ensure consistent server/client rendering
   - May need to disable SSR for theme or use proper hydration-safe patterns

2. **Verify Enhancement-History Integration**
   - Check if enhancement requests are actually calling the history save endpoint
   - Debug the flow from enhancement completion to history storage
   - Ensure authenticated users' enhancements are being saved

### Once Hydration is Fixed
3. **Complete E2E Testing**
   - Verify enhancements are saved to history
   - Test history persistence across sessions
   - Test history navigation and filtering
   - Test prompt rerun functionality

4. **Create API Documentation**
   - Document the three history endpoints
   - Include request/response examples
   - Add authentication requirements

## Technical Details

### Working Endpoints
```bash
# Get history (requires auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost/api/v1/prompts/history

# Get specific prompt (requires auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost/api/v1/prompts/{id}

# Rerun prompt (requires auth)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost/api/v1/prompts/{id}/rerun

# Get techniques (public)
curl http://localhost/api/v1/techniques
```

### Database Schema
- Table: prompts.history
- Columns: id (UUID), user_id, original_input, enhanced_output, technique_used, techniques_used (array), metadata (JSONB), created_at, updated_at

## Conclusion

Phase 4 backend implementation is complete and functional. The main blocker is the React hydration error preventing proper frontend rendering. Once this is resolved, the E2E tests should be able to verify the full enhancement-to-history flow is working correctly.
