# Enhanced Chain of Thought (CoT) Documentation

## Overview

The enhanced Chain of Thought implementation provides intelligent, adaptive reasoning patterns that automatically adjust to problem complexity and domain. This implementation maintains full backward compatibility while adding sophisticated features for production use.

## Features

### 1. Domain-Specific Reasoning

The enhanced CoT automatically detects and applies domain-specific reasoning patterns:

- **Mathematical**: Formula identification, calculation steps, verification
- **Algorithmic**: Requirements analysis, complexity considerations, edge cases
- **Analytical**: Scope definition, pattern recognition, evidence-based conclusions
- **Debugging**: Issue reproduction, hypothesis testing, systematic isolation
- **Logical**: Premise identification, deductive reasoning, contradiction checking

### 2. Adaptive Complexity Handling

The system analyzes prompt complexity and adjusts accordingly:

- **Simple (< 0.3)**: 3 concise steps for straightforward problems
- **Moderate (0.3-0.6)**: 5 standard steps with balanced detail
- **Complex (0.6-0.8)**: 5-6 steps with additional verification
- **Very Complex (> 0.8)**: Maximum detail with comprehensive analysis

### 3. Quality Metrics

Built-in metrics to evaluate reasoning quality:

- **Step Coverage**: Measures completeness of reasoning steps
- **Reasoning Depth**: Evaluates logical connections and explanations
- **Coherence**: Assesses flow and transitions between steps
- **Completeness**: Checks for proper conclusions

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)

```python
# Simple usage - uses enhanced mode by default
config = {"name": "chain_of_thought", "enabled": True, "priority": 1}
technique = ChainOfThoughtTechnique(config)

result = technique.apply("Solve this mathematical equation")
```

### Enhanced Mode with Context

```python
# Explicit domain and complexity
context = {
    "domain": "algorithmic",
    "complexity": 0.8,
    "show_substeps": True
}

result = technique.apply(
    "Design an efficient sorting algorithm", 
    context
)
```

### Custom Reasoning Steps (Basic Mode)

```python
# Custom steps trigger basic mode for compatibility
context = {
    "reasoning_steps": [
        "Understand the requirements",
        "Design the solution",
        "Implement and test"
    ]
}

result = technique.apply("Build a feature", context)
```

### Disable Enhanced Mode

```python
# Force basic mode
config = {
    "name": "chain_of_thought",
    "enabled": True,
    "priority": 1,
    "enhanced_mode": False
}

# Or via context
context = {"enhanced": False}
```

## Configuration Options

### Config Parameters

- `enhanced_mode` (bool): Enable/disable enhanced features (default: True)
- `name` (str): Technique name
- `enabled` (bool): Enable/disable technique
- `priority` (int): Application priority when multiple techniques are used

### Context Parameters

- `enhanced` (bool): Override enhanced mode for this call
- `domain` (str): Force specific domain (mathematical, algorithmic, etc.)
- `complexity` (float): Override complexity detection (0-1)
- `show_substeps` (bool): Show detailed sub-steps
- `reasoning_steps` (list): Custom steps (triggers basic mode)

## Domain Detection

The system automatically detects domains based on keywords:

### Mathematical
- Keywords: equation, calculate, solve for, formula, integral, derivative
- Features: Mathematical notation support, formula emphasis, calculation verification

### Algorithmic
- Keywords: algorithm, implement, code, function, complexity, data structure
- Features: Complexity analysis, edge case consideration, implementation planning

### Debugging
- Keywords: bug, error, issue, fix, debug, crashes, exception
- Features: Systematic isolation, hypothesis testing, root cause analysis

### Analytical
- Keywords: analyze, examine, investigate, data, trends, patterns
- Features: Evidence gathering, multi-perspective evaluation, pattern recognition

### Logical
- Keywords: if/then, implies, therefore, premise, conclusion, proof
- Features: Formal logic steps, contradiction checking, deductive reasoning

## Complexity Estimation

The system considers multiple factors:

1. **Length**: Word count and structural complexity
2. **Requirements**: Multiple conditions, conjunctions, and dependencies
3. **Technical Density**: Acronyms, technical terminology
4. **Logical Structure**: Conditional statements, nested logic
5. **Process Indicators**: Step words (first, then, next, finally)

## Examples

### Simple Problem
```
Input: "What is 5 + 3?"

Output:
"What is 5 + 3?

Let's think through this step by step:

1. Identify given information and unknowns
2. Perform calculations step by step
3. Verify the solution

Please show all mathematical work and justify each step."
```

### Complex Problem
```
Input: "Design a distributed cache system that handles millions of requests per second with consistency guarantees and automatic failover."

Output:
"Design a distributed cache system that handles millions of requests per second with consistency guarantees and automatic failover.

This is a complex problem that requires careful analysis. Let's think through it systematically:

1. Understand the problem requirements
2. Identify input/output specifications
3. Consider edge cases and constraints
4. Design the algorithm approach
5. Analyze time and space complexity
6. Verify the solution and check edge cases

Please explain the algorithm design choices and complexity analysis."
```

## Quality Assurance

### Validation

The enhanced validation system scores prompts based on:
- Reasoning indicators (how, why, explain)
- Action words (solve, calculate, determine)
- Complexity indicators
- Domain-specific keywords

### Metrics Evaluation

After generation, evaluate quality using:
```python
metrics = technique.get_metrics(generated_text)
print(f"Step Coverage: {metrics['step_coverage']}")
print(f"Reasoning Depth: {metrics['reasoning_depth']}")
print(f"Coherence: {metrics['coherence']}")
print(f"Completeness: {metrics['completeness']}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Let auto-detection work**: The system is good at detecting domains and complexity
2. **Override when needed**: Use context parameters for specific requirements
3. **Monitor metrics**: Use quality metrics to ensure good reasoning
4. **Maintain compatibility**: Use `reasoning_steps` for legacy behavior
5. **Adjust complexity**: Set complexity manually for consistent results

## Performance Considerations

- Domain detection: O(n) where n is text length
- Complexity estimation: O(n) with regex operations
- Step generation: O(1) with pre-defined patterns
- Overall overhead: Minimal (~5-10ms for typical prompts)

## Troubleshooting

### Enhanced features not working
- Check `enhanced_mode` in config
- Verify `enhanced` isn't set to False in context
- Ensure no `reasoning_steps` in context (triggers basic mode)

### Wrong domain detected
- Override with `context["domain"] = "your_domain"`
- Check if keywords match expected domain

### Inappropriate complexity
- Override with `context["complexity"] = 0.7`
- Adjust thresholds in configuration if needed

### Fallback to basic mode
- Check logs for errors
- Verify context parameters are valid
- Enhanced mode fails gracefully to basic mode
