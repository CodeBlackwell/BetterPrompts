  - Prompt Generator (Python/FastAPI) - 20% complete
- **ML Infrastructure**: TorchServe with DeBERTa-v3 - 100% complete
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL + Redis - Schema defined, integration pending
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana - Fully configured

## Critical Dependencies
- **Blocking Issues**: ML model integration, prompt generation logic
- **External APIs**: OpenAI, Anthropic (for LLM integration)
