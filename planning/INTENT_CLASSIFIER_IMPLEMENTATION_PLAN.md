## Quick Commands Reference

### Testing Current System
```bash
# Test intent classifier directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/intents/classify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "explain quantum computing to a 5 year old"}' | jq '.'

# Check classifier logs
docker compose logs intent-classifier -f

# Restart classifier
docker compose restart intent-classifier
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Run local tests
cd backend/services/intent-classifier
python test_enhanced_classifier.py
python test_hybrid_classifier.py

# Check model accuracy
python scripts/evaluate_classifier.py --test-file data/test.json

# Generate more training data
python scripts/generate_training_data.py --count 1000 --intent question_answering
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Model size**: DistilBERT is 250MB â†’ Use ONNX and quantization
2. **Latency spikes**: Multiple model calls â†’ Implement caching and batching
3. **Memory usage**: Multiple models loaded â†’ Use model pooling and lazy loading
4. **Training data quality**: Synthetic data bias â†’ Validate with real examples

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with rule-based only, gradually add ML models
- Implement circuit breakers for each model
- Monitor performance metrics continuously
- Collect real user data for model improvement
- Regular A/B testing to validate improvements
