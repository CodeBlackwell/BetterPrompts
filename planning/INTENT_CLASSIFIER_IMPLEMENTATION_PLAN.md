## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Model size**: DistilBERT is 250MB → Use ONNX and quantization
2. **Latency spikes**: Multiple model calls → Implement caching and batching
3. **Memory usage**: Multiple models loaded → Use model pooling and lazy loading
4. **Training data quality**: Synthetic data bias → Validate with real examples

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with rule-based only, gradually add ML models
- Implement circuit breakers for each model
- Monitor performance metrics continuously
- Collect real user data for model improvement
- Regular A/B testing to validate improvements
