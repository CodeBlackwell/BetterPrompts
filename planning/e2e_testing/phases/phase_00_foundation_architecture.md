## Success Metrics
- ✅ All user stories documented with testable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Test architecture approved by engineering team
- ✅ Tool selection validated with POCs
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline design complete

## Progress Tracking
- ✅ Test architecture design document created
- ✅ User story inventory completed (20 stories)
- ✅ User journey maps for all 5 personas
- ✅ Test scenario matrix (60+ scenarios)
- ✅ Tool stack selected (Playwright + K6 + Pact + OWASP ZAP)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline architecture designed

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Complete User Story Inventory
- ✅ 20 detailed user stories with acceptance criteria (exceeded target)
- ✅ User journey maps for all 5 personas
- ✅ Test scenario matrix with 60+ scenarios (exceeded target)

### 2. Architecture Documents Created
- `e2e/wave1-test-architecture.md` - Comprehensive 7,800+ line architecture document
- `e2e/wave1-executive-summary.md` - Executive summary with key recommendations

### 3. Test Architecture Design
```yaml
test-stack:
  ui-testing:
    framework: Playwright
    languages: TypeScript
    pattern: Page Object Model
  api-testing:
    framework: Jest + Supertest
    contract-testing: Pact
    load-testing: K6
  integration:
    framework: Jest
    test-containers: PostgreSQL, Redis
  security:
    tools: OWASP ZAP, Snyk
    standards: OWASP Top 10
```

### 4. Key Achievements
- Recommended tool stack: Playwright + K6 + Pact + OWASP ZAP (all open source)
- Designed 3-layer test architecture with parallel execution support
- Created CI/CD pipeline supporting 15 parallel test streams
- Established 8-week implementation roadmap

## Notes & Updates

### 2025-01-26
- Phase completed successfully
- All deliverables exceeded expectations
- Ready to proceed with implementation phases

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Tool Selection**: Chose Playwright over Cypress for better performance and debugging
2. **Architecture**: 3-layer design with POM pattern for maintainability
3. **Parallel Execution**: Designed for 15 concurrent test streams
4. **Open Source**: All tools are open source to minimize costs

### Lessons Learned
- Comprehensive planning upfront saves significant time during implementation
- User story mapping revealed more scenarios than initially anticipated
- Tool POCs were critical for making informed decisions
