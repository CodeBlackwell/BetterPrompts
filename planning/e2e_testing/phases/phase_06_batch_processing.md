# Phase 6: Batch Processing Upload (US-003)

## Overview
- **User Story**: "As a content creator, I want to process multiple prompts at once"
- **Duration**: 4 days
- **Complexity**: High - File upload, async processing, progress tracking
- **Status**: ðŸ”’ BLOCKED (Requires Phase 4)

## Dependencies
- **Depends On**: Phase 4 (Authenticated Enhancement)
- **Enables**: Advanced bulk operations
- **Can Run In Parallel With**: None (requires auth features)

## Why This Next
- Builds on authenticated features
- Tests async workflows
- Validates file handling
- Performance-critical feature

## Implementation Command
```bash
/sc:implement --think --validate \
  "Test US-003: Batch prompt processing via CSV upload" \
  --context "Test file upload, async processing, progress tracking" \
  --requirements '
  1. CSV file upload (up to 1000 prompts)
  2. File validation (format, size, content)
  3. Async processing with progress bar
  4. Email notification when complete
  5. Download results as CSV/JSON
  6. Handle processing errors gracefully
  ' \
  --steps '
  1. Test file upload mechanics
  2. Test CSV validation rules
  3. Test progress tracking UI
  4. Test completion notifications
  5. Test result downloads
  6. Test error scenarios
  ' \
  --deliverables '
  - e2e/tests/us-003-batch-processing.spec.ts
  - Page objects: BatchUploadPage, ProgressTracker
  - CSV test file generator
  - Async polling utilities
  - Download verification helpers
  ' \
  --output-dir "e2e/phase6"
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 100 prompts process in <60s
- [ ] Progress updates every 2s
- [ ] Downloads work correctly
- [ ] Errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Email notifications sent
- [ ] Results match input order

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Test file created: `us-003-batch-processing.spec.ts`
- [ ] BatchUploadPage page object implemented
- [ ] ProgressTracker component tests
- [ ] CSV generator utility created
- [ ] File upload tests complete
- [ ] Validation tests complete
- [ ] Progress tracking tests complete
- [ ] Download tests complete
- [ ] Error handling tests complete
- [ ] Performance tests complete
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Login as user
2. Navigate to batch upload
3. Upload valid CSV (10 prompts)
4. Monitor progress bar
5. Receive completion notification
6. Download results

### File Upload Tests
- Valid CSV formats
- Excel file (.xlsx) support
- Text file with one prompt per line
- Drag and drop upload
- Click to browse upload
- Multiple file rejection

### Validation Tests
- Empty file
- Too many prompts (>1000)
- Invalid CSV format
- Missing required columns
- Invalid characters
- File size limits (>10MB)

### Progress Tracking Tests
- Real-time progress updates
- Accurate percentage calculation
- Time remaining estimate
- Pause/resume capability
- Cancel operation
- Progress persistence on refresh

### Result Handling Tests
- Download as CSV
- Download as JSON
- Results match input order
- Enhanced prompts included
- Technique metadata included
- Error rows marked

### Error Scenarios
- Network interruption during upload
- Server timeout during processing
- Partial batch failure
- Invalid prompts in batch
- Concurrent batch uploads
- Storage quota exceeded

## Notes & Updates

### Prerequisites
- Authenticated user features working
- Batch upload UI implemented
- API endpoints: `/api/v1/batch/upload`, `/api/v1/batch/status/{id}`, `/api/v1/batch/download/{id}`
- Background job processing system
- Email notification service

### CSV Format Specification
```csv
prompt,category,tags
"Help me write a blog post","content","writing,blog"
"Explain quantum computing","education","science,physics"
"Create a marketing plan","business","marketing,strategy"
```

### Implementation Tips
1. Generate test CSVs programmatically
2. Test various file sizes (1, 10, 100, 1000 prompts)
3. Mock long-running processes for faster tests
4. Test progress websocket updates
5. Verify result ordering preserved

### Progress Tracking Strategy
```javascript
// WebSocket updates
- Connection established
- Progress updates (0-100%)
- Completion notification
- Error notifications

// Polling fallback
- Check status every 2s
- Handle connection loss
- Resume from last known state
```

### Common Issues
- **Upload fails**: Check file size limits and CORS
- **Progress stuck**: Verify websocket connection
- **Download fails**: Check blob handling and CORS
- **Order mismatch**: Ensure backend preserves order
