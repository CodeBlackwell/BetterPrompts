- Week 4: Phase 13 (Journeys)

**Developer C: Quality Specialist**
- Week 1: Phase 9 (Edge Cases)
- Week 2: Phase 11 prep
- Week 3: Phase 11 (Security)
- Week 4: Phase 14 (Smoke Tests)

**Advantages:**
- Maximum parallelization
- Deep specialization
- Fastest delivery

**Challenges:**
- Higher coordination overhead
- More complex integration
- Requires experienced team

## Parallelization Matrix

### Independent Phases (Can Start Anytime)
- **Phase 1**: Anonymous Enhancement
- **Phase 5**: Technique Tooltips
- **Phase 7**: API Integration
- **Phase 9**: Input Edge Cases
- **Phase 12**: Mobile & Accessibility

### Sequential Dependencies

#### Authentication Chain
```
Phase 2 (Registration)
    ↓
Phase 3 (Login)
    ↓
Phase 4 (Auth Enhancement)
    ↓
Phase 6 (Batch Processing)
```

#### API Chain
```
Phase 7 (API Integration)
    ↓
Phase 8 (Performance) + Phase 10 (Rate Limiting)
```

#### Final Integration
```
All Phases (1-12)
    ↓
Phase 13 (Complete Journeys)
    ↓
Phase 14 (Production Smoke)
```

## Critical Path

The minimum phases required for a functional E2E test suite:

1. **Phase 1**: Core functionality (3 days)
2. **Phase 2-3**: Authentication (5 days)
3. **Phase 7**: API basics (3 days)
4. **Phase 11**: Security validation (4 days)
5. **Phase 14**: Production monitoring (2 days)

**Total Critical Path**: 17 days (~3.5 weeks)

## Quick Start Commands

### Day 1 - Start Testing
```bash
# Begin with the simplest story
/sc:implement --think --validate \
  "Test US-001: Anonymous prompt enhancement flow" \
  --output-dir "e2e/phase1"
```

### After Auth UI Exists
```bash
# Run authentication phases in sequence
/sc:implement "Test US-012: User registration flow" --output-dir "e2e/phase2"
/sc:implement "Test US-013: Login and session management" --output-dir "e2e/phase3"
```

### Parallel Quality Track
```bash
# Can run these anytime
/sc:implement "Test edge cases EC-01 to EC-05" --output-dir "e2e/phase9"
/sc:implement "Test mobile and accessibility" --output-dir "e2e/phase12"
```

## Milestone Checkpoints

### Milestone 1: Core Functionality (Week 2)

- [ ] Basic E2E tests running
- [ ] CI pipeline integrated
- **Deliverable**: Working test suite for anonymous users

### Milestone 2: Authentication (Week 4)
- [ ] Phases 2-4 complete
- [ ] User flows tested
- [ ] Session management verified
- **Deliverable**: Complete auth test coverage

### Milestone 3: Advanced Features (Week 6)
- [ ] Phases 5-7, 9 complete
- [ ] API tests implemented
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- **Deliverable**: Full feature test coverage

### Milestone 4: Production Ready (Week 8)
- [ ] All phases complete
- [ ] Security validated
- [ ] Performance verified
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready E2E suite

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **UI Not Ready**: Create mock UI components
- **API Delays**: Use mock services initially
- **Performance Issues**: Start optimization early
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Run security tests continuously

### Resource Risks
- **Developer Availability**: Plan for 20% buffer time
- **Skill Gaps**: Provide Playwright training
- **Tool Issues**: Have backup tools ready
- **Environment Problems**: Use containerization

### Schedule Risks
- **Dependencies**: Start independent phases first
- **Integration Issues**: Plan integration weeks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined user stories
- **Technical Debt**: Allocate refactoring time

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Progression
- **Week 2**: 10% (Core functionality)
- **Week 4**: 35% (+ Authentication)
- **Week 6**: 70% (+ Features)
- **Week 8**: 95% (+ Quality/Security)

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Stability**: <5% flake rate
- **Execution Time**: <30 minutes full suite
- **Maintenance**: <2 hours/week
- **Coverage**: >95% user journeys
