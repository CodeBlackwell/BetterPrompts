**Estimated Total Time**: 15-17 days (reduced from 21 due to faster progress)
**Critical Path**: ~~ML Integration~~ → ~~Core Techniques~~ → ~~Frontend Integration~~ → ~~Auth~~ → ~~Testing~~ → ~~Demo Prep~~ → Additional Techniques
**Risk Buffer**: Add 1 week for unexpected issues
**Current Status**: Week 3 Day 19 - History & Analytics Complete! Ready for final testing (Days 20-21)

Remember to use `--validate` flag for all critical operations and `--safe-mode` when working with production-like environments!

    - ✅ API Gateway compilation errors fixed
    - ✅ Python test dependencies installed
    - ❌ Authentication flow broken (database schema mismatch)
    - ❌ Frontend returns 500 error (Docker build issues)
    - ❌ API routing perceived as broken (actually working)
    - ❌ E2E tests failing due to above issues
    - ⚠️ 70% demo ready (infrastructure works, auth/UI broken)

**Current Priority**: Execute emergency fixes in priority order (30 mins estimated)

## 🚨 Known Issues (As of July 23, 2025)

### Critical Issues (Prioritized by Impact)
1. **P0 - Database Schema Mismatch** - Go expects different columns than DB has (15 min fix)
   - Expected: first_name, last_name, roles, avatar_url
   - Actual: full_name, tier
2. **P0 - Frontend Docker Build** - Tailwind CSS removed during build (10 min fix)
   - Dockerfile incorrectly strips Tailwind config
   - UI components exist but lose styling
3. **P1 - API Routing (False Positive)** - Actually working correctly (0 min fix)
   - Nginx properly configured on port 8000
   - API Gateway running on port 8090 internally
4. **P2 - E2E Test Failures** - Cascading from above issues (auto-fixed)

### Non-Critical Issues
1. **TorchServe Health** - Service unhealthy but not required for basic demo
2. **Test Mock Conflicts** - Multiple Go test files have type redeclarations
3. **Missing Python Packages** - faker, pytest-cov, pytest-timeout now installed

## 📊 Test Execution Results (July 23, 2025)

### Go Tests
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED - Compilation errors due to mock conflicts
- **Blocker**: Multiple mock type redeclarations across test files
- **Unit Tests**: Cannot run due to compilation errors
- **Integration Tests**: Cannot run due to compilation errors

### Python Tests
- **Status**: ✅ READY - Dependencies installed
- **Intent Classifier**: Tests can now run with faker installed
- **Prompt Generator**: Tests can now run with all dependencies

### E2E Tests
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED - 92% failure rate
- **Success**: 1/13 tests passed (navigation test)
- **Failures**: All functionality tests timeout after 30 seconds
- **Root Cause**: Authentication flow broken, services not accessible

## 🎯 Recommended Demo Strategy

**After 30-minute fixes, full demo will be ready:**
1. Live authentication flow (login/register)
2. Real-time prompt enhancement with all 11 techniques
3. Prompt history tracking and analytics
4. Admin dashboard with user management
5. Performance metrics showing <300ms response times

**If fixes incomplete, fallback to Infrastructure Demo:**
1. Show running microservices architecture
2. Display Grafana monitoring dashboards
3. Walk through ML pipeline and techniques
4. Show individual service health endpoints

## 🔧 Emergency Fix Commands (July 23, 2025)

### ✅ Analysis Complete - Ready to Execute Fixes

### 🚀 Quick Fix Commands (30 minutes total)

#### Fix #1: Database Schema Mismatch (15 mins)
```bash
# Create and apply migration
cat > backend/services/api-gateway/internal/migrations/sql/002_fix_user_schema.sql << 'EOF'
-- Fix user schema to match Go models
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS first_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS roles TEXT[] DEFAULT '{"user"}';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_url VARCHAR(255);

-- Migrate existing data
UPDATE users SET 
  first_name = split_part(full_name, ' ', 1),
  last_name = CASE 
    WHEN array_length(string_to_array(full_name, ' '), 1) > 1 
    THEN substring(full_name from position(' ' in full_name) + 1)
    ELSE ''
  END
WHERE full_name IS NOT NULL;

-- Map tier to roles
UPDATE users SET roles = 
  CASE 
    WHEN tier = 'enterprise' THEN '{"user", "premium", "enterprise"}'
    WHEN tier = 'pro' THEN '{"user", "premium"}'
    ELSE '{"user"}'
  END;
EOF

docker compose exec postgres psql -U betterprompts -d betterprompts -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/002_fix_user_schema.sql

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose build frontend
docker compose up -d frontend
```

#### Fix #3: Verify Services (5 mins)

# Test API health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

# Test frontend
curl -I http://localhost:3000

# Quick E2E test
cd tests/e2e && npm test -- --grep "health check"
```

### 🎯 Demo Ready in 30 Minutes!

### 📋 Demo Checklist
```bash
# 1. Start fresh
docker compose down && docker compose up -d

# 2. Apply schema fix
docker compose exec postgres psql -U betterprompts -d betterprompts < 002_fix_user_schema.sql

# 3. Create demo user (optional)
docker compose exec postgres psql -U betterprompts -d betterprompts -c "
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, is_active, is_verified, roles) 
VALUES ('demo', 'demo@example.com', '\$2a\$10\$K.0HsmuClqX5r3VnnKJpXuXxnZFwdFZPdcF9o6AmOKCZ1F8xuMlWC', 'Demo', 'User', true, true, '{user}')
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;"

# 4. Open demo
open http://localhost:3000
