# Docker Network Fix Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Issue Resolution

### Initial Problem
Docker Desktop couldn't resolve `registry-1.docker.io`, preventing image pulls with error:
```
failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/alpine:latest: 
dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io: no such host
```

### Root Causes Identified & Fixed

1. **Docker Networking Issue** âœ…
   - **Symptom**: DNS resolution failing for Docker Hub
   - **Fix**: Restarted Docker Desktop
   - **Result**: All network tests now passing

2. **Go Version Mismatch** âœ…
   - **Issue**: go.mod requires Go 1.23+, Dockerfile used Go 1.21
   - **Fix**: Updated Dockerfile to use `golang:1.23-alpine`
   - **Result**: Correct Go version now used

3. **Alpine Version** âœ…
   - **Issue**: Using `alpine:latest` which can cause resolution issues
   - **Fix**: Changed to specific version `alpine:3.19`
   - **Result**: Consistent builds

4. **Build Command** âœ…
   - **Issue**: Building only main.go instead of entire package
   - **Fix**: Changed to `go build ./cmd/server`
   - **Result**: Proper package building

## Current Status

### âœ… Fixed Issues
- Docker networking fully operational
- DNS resolution working correctly
- Docker Hub accessible
- Image pulls successful
- Go version compatibility resolved
- Dockerfile optimized

### ðŸš§ Remaining Code Issue
The build now fails due to duplicate type declarations in the Go code:
```
Role redeclared in this block
Permission redeclared in this block
"time" imported and not used
```

This is a code issue, not a Docker/networking issue.

## Verification Tests

All tests passing:
```bash
./scripts/test-docker-network.sh
# Output:
# 1. Docker running: âœ“ YES
# 2. Internet access: âœ“ YES
# 3. Docker Hub access: âœ“ YES
# 4. DNS resolution: âœ“ YES
# 5. Docker pull test: âœ“ YES
```

## Next Steps

To fix the remaining Go compilation errors:
```bash
# Remove duplicate declarations
cd backend/services/api-gateway
# Check and fix duplicate Role/Permission structs in:
# - internal/models/user_requests.go
# - internal/models/complete_models.go

# Remove unused import in:
# - internal/models/models.go (remove unused "time" import)
```

## Files Modified

1. **Dockerfile Updates**:
   - Go version: 1.21 â†’ 1.23
   - Alpine version: latest â†’ 3.19
   - Build command: Fixed to build entire package
   - Added `go mod tidy` step

2. **Created Scripts**:
   - `scripts/test-docker-network.sh` - Network diagnostics
   - `scripts/fix-docker-network.sh` - Automated fix attempts

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always use specific image versions** instead of `:latest`
2. **Match Go versions** between go.mod and Dockerfile
3. **Docker Desktop networking** can be fixed by restart
4. **Build entire packages** not just individual files

The Docker networking issue is now completely resolved. The API Gateway can be built once the Go code compilation errors are fixed.
